  {
    chocolate: 'Dark',
    texture: 'Nuts & Crunchy',
    flavor: 'Spicy',
    pairing: 'Dark chocolate bark with chili-roasted almonds and a smoky mezcal on the side.',
    whyItWorks: 'The chili\'s capsaicin makes the cocoa flavors taste deeper and richer, while roasted nuts add umami and crunch; mezcal\'s smoky notes mirror dark chocolate\'s earthy aromatics, so everything feels intentionally intense instead of just "too bitter."',

    chocolate: 'Dark',
    texture: 'Plain',
    flavor: 'Spicy',
    pairing: 'Simple 70–80% dark chocolate with a chili–cinnamon hot chocolate or chili-infused black tea.',
    whyItWorks: 'With no extra toppings, you get a clean triangle of bitter + sweet + heat, where capsaicin heightens your perception of cocoa\'s fruity notes and the spice warmth lingers pleasantly instead of burning.',

    flavor: 'Coffee',
    pairing: 'Dark chocolate with hazelnuts alongside a short, intense espresso.',

    flavor: 'Boozy',
    pairing: 'Bold dark chocolate with nuts and boozy flavors pairs excellently with a rich whiskey or dark rum.',

    texture: 'Smooth & Creamy',
    flavor: 'Spicy',
    pairing: 'Dark chocolate ganache with a hint of chili, served with chai-spiced dark hot chocolate.',
    whyItWorks: 'The extra fat from cream buffers the spice, so you get a slow, cozy warmth instead of a harsh burn, and the spices (cardamom, ginger, cinnamon) echo chocolate\'s naturally warm, baked notes.',

  {
    chocolate: 'Dark',
    texture: 'Smooth & Creamy',

    pairing: 'Pair creamy dark chocolate with brandy or tawny port.',

    texture: 'Nuts & Crunchy',
    flavor: 'Classic Sweet',
    pairing: 'Try dark chocolate with walnut banana bread or toasted nut loaf.',

    flavor: 'Coffee',
    pairing: 'Dark chocolate and coffee are a match made in heaven - try them together for a rich, energizing treat.',

    chocolate: 'Milk',
    texture: 'Smooth & Creamy',
    flavor: 'Classic Sweet',
    pairing: 'Enjoy your milk chocolate with a warm cup of lavendar tea or a glass of cold milk for the perfect cozy moment.',
    whyItWorks: 'The extra dairy echoes milk chocolate\'s creamy profile, while gentle floral/vanilla notes add complexity without adding more sugar. Studies on fat–sweetness interaction show that fat can dampen bitterness and make sweetness feel rounder and more "full," which is exactly what\'s happening in this cozy combo.',

  // White Chocolate Combinations
  {
    chocolate: 'White',
    texture: 'Smooth & Creamy',
    flavor: 'Fruity',
    pairing: 'White chocolate panna cotta topped with raspberries and passion fruit.',
    whyItWorks: 'White chocolate is basically cocoa butter + sugar, so it loves acidity. Tart fruit cuts through the fat and makes the dessert taste bright instead of cloying. Many chocolatiers recommend pairing white chocolate with berries and tropical fruits for this reason.',

    pairing: 'Creamy white chocolate with classic sweetness pairs wonderfully with vanilla ice cream or a warm vanilla custard.',
    whyItWorks: 'Vanilla doubles down on white chocolate\'s sweet, creamy profile, turning it into a "birthday cake / bakery" flavor. Soft bread or ice cream adds comforting texture and just enough starch or cold to keep it from feeling too rich.',

    flavor: 'Fruity',
    pairing: 'White chocolate with pistachios and dried cranberries, plus chilled coconut water or a spritzer.',
